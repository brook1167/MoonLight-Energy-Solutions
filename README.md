# MoonLight Energy Solutions: Environmental Measurement Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the environmental measurement analysis conducted by MoonLight Energy Solutions. This project aims to enhance our operational efficiency and sustainability through strategic solar investments. As part of this initiative, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on environmental measurement data provided by the engineering team to identify key trends and generate actionable insights.

## Project Details

### Analysis Overview

- **Data Source**: Environmental measurements from the engineering team.
- **Tools Used**: Python (with libraries for data analysis and visualization).
- **Objective**: Perform EDA to uncover trends and provide data-driven recommendations.

### Key Insights

The EDA revealed several crucial insights:
- **Trend Identification**: Notable trends in environmental measurements that affect solar energy investments.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identified patterns that suggest opportunities for enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Data-driven strategies based on the analysis to guide decision-making.
